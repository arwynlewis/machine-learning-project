# Machine Learning Project - Forest Fire/Deforestation and Resilience

## Research Question
How do forest fires/the impacts of deforestation affect the following factors: temperature, humidity, and vegetation in the area? How does the environment generally react to these events? What is a forestâ€™s level of resilience? 

## Data Sources
Data was collected from the following sources:
- Fire detection areas
    - NASA Fire Information for Resource Management System: https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/usfs/active_fire/
    - Automated retrieval of files in the 2015-2025 time range (code is given below for implementation)
- General forest related data
    - Global Forest Watch tree cover and fire alert data downloaded from dashboards: https://www.globalforestwatch.org/
- Weather data
    - Climate Data Store API (code is given below for implementation)
